ActionDescriptor
This object provides a dictionary-style mechanism for storing data as key-value pairs. It can be used for
low-level access into Photoshop. See an example of this usage in ‘Selection sample script’ on page 168.
Many configuration files use serialized action descriptors to represent their data. It is used, for example, to
encapsulate playback options in Application.playbackParameters, and is returned by
Application.getCustomOptions().

ActionList
This object provides an array-style mechanism for storing data. It can be used for low-level access into
Photoshop.
This object is ideal when storing data of the same type. All items in the list must be of the same type.
You can use the "put" methods, such as putBoolean(), to append new elements, and can clear the entire
list using clear(), but cannot otherwise modify the list.
Note: The ActionList object is part of the Action Manager functionality. For details on using the Action
Manager, see the Photoshop CC Scripting Guide.

Application
The Adobe Adobe Photoshop CC application object, which is the root of the object model and provides
access to all other objects. This object provides application-wide information, such as application defaults
and available fonts. It provides many important methods , such as those for opening files and loading
documents.
To access the properties and methods, you can use the pre-defined global variable app. For example:
var docRef = app.documents.add(800, 600, 72, "docRef", NewDocumentMode.RGB);
The properties and methods of the Application object are also available at the top level; you can omit
references to the Application object altogether. For example:
var docRef = documents.add(800, 600, 72, "docRef", NewDocumentMode.RGB);
This usage can be somewhat ambiguous; for clarity, it is recommended that you use an explicit reference
to app.

3 JavaScript Resource
This section describes the JavaScript resource that enables your JavaScripts to behave like a plug-in. This
includes:
● the ability to specify a menu the script appears in as a command,
● a terminology resource so the script can function with the Action Manager, which allows your script to
record and be automated by scripting parameters,
● a category to enable ordering and grouping of commands within menus, and
● an enable string that indicates whether the command is enabled or disabled given a set of conditions.
● The strings must be valid XML syntax. The "&" character will not work for example. Use the &amp;&amp;
for example to get logical ‘&&’ in the enableinfo block.
JavaScript resource syntax
The JavaScript Resource has an HTML-style syntax, with each <tag> matched by a closing </tag>. This
resource needs to appear within comments ( /* ... */) and should be defined at the top of your script
file (within the first 10,240 characters of the file.)
Tag Description
<javascriptresource> The resource definition tag.
<name> The command name that appears in the Photoshop menu.
If this tag is not provided in the resource, the name of the command in the
menu defaults to the name of the script.
<menu> The menu the command appears in. If this tag is not provided, the
command appears in the File > Scripts menu.
Note: Currently the only supported values for <menu> are automate,
filter and help. automate puts the script in the File >
Automate menu for example.
<about> A string that appears in an About box, which the user can select from the
Help > About Plug-in menu.
<enableinfo> A boolean expression that indicates whether the command is enabled in
the menu. See Enable-info grammar.
Note: If you provide this tag, the menu item is enabled if and only if there
is at least one document open, and the boolean expression
evaluates to true. If you always want the menu item enabled, do not
use this tag.
<eventid> A unique string that identifies the event. Using a UUID will ensure that your
script wont share this identifier with another script.Adobe Photoshop CC
JavaScript Scripting Reference JavaScript Resource 190
Basic JavaScript resource example
This example shows a very basic <javascriptresource>. With this resource, the script can be executed
by selecting the command Add a Document, which appears in the Automate menu. This command is
enabled in the menu, provided at least one document is already open. If the user requests information
about the script from the About Plug-in menu, the string contained in the <about> tag is displayed in a
dialog box.
/*
<javascriptresource>
<name>Add a Document</name>
<type>automate</type>
<about>A short string providing information about the script.</about>
<enableinfo>true</enableinfo>
</javascriptresource>
*/
app.documents.add();
Enable-info grammar
The <enableinfo> tag provides a boolean expression that, when evaluated, indicates whether the
command is enabled in the menu. You can use this expression to enable or disable the menu item based
on various characteristics of the document. The Enable Info grammar is as follows:
<category> The category the command appears within in the menu. Used to group
and order commands in the menu. Commands are placed in the menu
alphabetically based on the string in <category>. If two commands use
the same category, they are grouped together.
<terminology> The terminology dictionary for the script to function with the Action
Manager. See the Terminology dictionary.
Tag Description
<booleanExpression> := <conjunction> { "||" <conjunction> }
<conjunction> := <relation> {"&&" <relation> }
<relation> := <equality> {<relationOperator><equality>}
<equality> := <simpleExpression> {<equalityOperator><simpleExpression>}
<simpleExpression> := <term> {<addOperator><term>}
<term> := <factor> {<mulOperator><factor>}
<factor> := <integer> | <intrinsic> | <ident> |
"(" <booleanExpression ")" | "(" simpleExpression ")" |
"+" <factor> | "-" <factor> | "!" <factor>
<integer> := digit {digit}
<intrinsic> := <limitFunction> | <dimFunction> | <inFunction>
<limitFunction> := ( "min" | "max") "(" <simpleExpression> ","
<simpleExpression> { "," <simpleExpression> } ")"
<dimFunction> := "dim" "(" <simpleExpression> "," <simpleExpression> ")"Adobe Photoshop CC
JavaScript Scripting Reference JavaScript Resource 191
Operator precedence is shown in the following table. Operators are listed with the highest order of
precedence at the top of the table
The grammar provides variables and constants that you can use in the <enableinfo> expression. The
following table provides a list of the constants that are available.
<ident> := (alpha | "_") {alpha | digit | "_" }
<mulOperator> := "*" | "/"
<addOperator> := "+" | "-"
<equalityOperator> := "==" | "!="
<relationOperator> := "<" | "<=" | ">=" | ">"
<inFunction> := "in" "(" <simpleExpression> {"," <simpleExpression> } ")"
Operator Description
|| Or

The following table show the set of variables you can use in the <enableinfo> expression. The value of
these variables is set based on the properties of the active document.
Undefined values in enable-info evaluation
If any arithmetic or relation operation contains an operand whose value is undefined, or a variable that is
undefined, the result of that evaluation is false.
Boolean values are treated as in C/C++, where non-zero values are true, and zero is false, with the
exception that an undefined value is also false.
Gray16Mode Grayscale mode, 16 bits per channel
RGB48Mode RGB color mode, 16 bits per channel.

JavaScript Scripting Reference JavaScript Resource 193
Using the "in" function
The in function (see <inFunction>) returns true is the first parameter is equal to at least one of the
subsequent parameters. A typical use might be to see if the image mode of the active document is one of
a set of image modes. For example:
in(PSHOP_ImageMode, RGBMode, CMYKMode, LabMode)
Action Manager automation
For your script to be able to record scripting parameters and be automated by them, it requires the
addition of two basic mechanisms:
● A terminology dictionary that maps your script’s user interface to human readable text, providing text
and type information for each parameter the script uses.
● Code to read parameter information when it comes from the Action Manager, rather than from the
user-interface, and code to write parameter information to the Action Manger. This code uses the
Action Manager classes ActionDescriptor, ActionList, and ActionReference.
See Conditional Mode Change.jsx for an example of a script that can record and be automated by
scripting parameters. This file can be found in the Presets/Scripts folder.
Terminology dictionary
The JavaScript resource provides a <terminology> tag that allows you to provide the terminology
dictionary for your script. The first step in creating a terminology dictionary is to review your script’s user
interface, and create human-readable strings for each element in your user interface.
For example, in the Conditional Mode Change command, the user interface requests a source mode and a
target mode. Both source mode and target mode have several options. All of these elements of the user
interface need to have entries in the terminology dictionary.
The terminology dictionary is created in a PDF dictionary format, with the following entries, and must have
the following format in the <javascriptresource>:
<terminology><![CDATA[<<<
/Version integer
/Events <<event dictionary>>
/Classes <<class dictionary>>
/Enumerations <<enumeration dictionary>>
>>> ]]></terminology>
Note: The information in the terminology tag needs to be wrapped in a CDATA block so the xml parser will
ignore "/" and other tags that appear in the terminology.
The defintions for events, classes and enumerations dictionaries are provided below.Adobe Photoshop CC
JavaScript Scripting Reference JavaScript Resource 194
The /Events dictionary contains an entry for each event:
The /Classes dictionary contains and entry for each class:
The /Enumerations dictionary contains an entry for each enumerated type:
Value type defintions
For /parameter type and /property type definitons, you can use the Class and Enumeration type
declarations you make in your own terminology dictionary, you can use declarations provided by
Photoshop or you can use basic value types.
Basic Value Types
The basic value types are shown in the following table:

Predefined Class Types
Photoshop provides a number of predefined classes that are available for use in the terminology
dictionary. A useful subset of those classes is shown in the table below. Use these classes when they are
appropriate, but you can define new classes in the terminology resource, if necessary.
Uniqueness rules for terminology entries
Generally, the names for terminology entries must be unique within a particular category and scope. It is
best to not make names unique unnecessarily; generic terms are prefereable, and if a name already exists
for something, go ahead and use it. Case matters in considering uniqueness of terminology entries.
The uniqueness rules for terminology entries are:
● All event names must be different from all other event names.
● All class names must be different from all other names.
● All enumeration type names must be different from all other enumeration type names.
● All keys must be different from all other keys used in the same class or event.
● All enumeration values must be different from all other enumeration values in the same enumeration
type.
● A class, event, enumeration type, key, and enumeration value can all have the same name.
Terminology definition example
This example demonstrates the terminology definition for a new event; the example uses ZStrings. The
event is called newAnnot, and it takes three parameters:
● annotType, an enumeration (annotType)
● at, a class (point), and
● size, a class (annotSizeClass).
typePaths 'Pth ' Windows file system path.
typePlatformFilePath 'alis' or'Pth typeAlias for Mac OS, typePath for Windows.

Appendix A: Event ID Codes
The following table lists events and their four-character ID codes or string identifiers for use with the
notifier object.
Note: Do not include single quotes ( ' ) with four-character IDs in your code. The single quotes are
used in this table to illustrate the placement of required spaces in codes that do not contain four
letters. However, string identifiers, which are longer than four characters, require double quotes in
the code.
Tip: If you can’t find the event you want to use for notification in this table, you can use ScriptListener to
determine the event ID code. See the ScriptListener documentation in the Action Manager chapter of
the Photoshop CC Scripting Guide.
